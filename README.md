# URL Shortener
A program that shortens a specific set of URLs with an additional feature of search optimization.

When a user inputs a URL, it can shorten it to whatever keywords it wants it to be shortened to. After shortening the URL, the shortened URL gets stored in a separate list of shortened URLs. 

# Search Optimization
Further, we see a search optimization feature. If the user wants to search for any specific URL, it can do so by either typing some common keywords present in the original or shortened URL or it can also write the note associated to it which is related to the content present on that URL's webpage
